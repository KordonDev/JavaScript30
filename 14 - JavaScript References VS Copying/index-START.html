    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    let players2 = players;

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    players2[3] = 'KordonDev';

    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(players2, players);

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    let player3 = players.slice();
    player3[3] = 'Kordon';

    // one day
    console.log(player3, players);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    let player4 = [].concat(players);
    player4[3] = 'New';

    console.log(player4, players);


    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    let player5 = [...players];
    player5[3] = 'Captain';
    
    console.log(player5, players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    let object = {
        course: 'JavaScript',
        number: 14,
        status: {
            date: null,
            done: false
        }
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    let object2 = object;
    object2.name = 'JavaScript30';
    console.log(object2, object);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    let object3 = Object.assign({}, object, {number: 15});
    console.log(object3, object);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    object3.status.done = true;
    console.log(object3.status, object.status);
